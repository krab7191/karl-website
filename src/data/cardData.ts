    'This photo was taken during a repair as a reference to insure the correct alignment of the two timing chains during the replacement of the balance shafts in my present car and represents the wide scope of abilities and experience in my life.  My childhood home included both wood and metal working equipment and both a stick and an oxy-acetylene rig.  Vehicle and appliance repairs were the norm.  My father was a co-owner of a company that manufactured air-impact pulverizers and at one point, rented out a section of the facility where I met aeronautical engineer Dr. Alexander Lippisch as I watched the building and test flight of a prototype ground effect aircraft.  I operated a milling machine and was given the controls of an airplane before entering high school.  Over the years, I have done full engine rebuilds, HVAC repairs, modified expansion chambers, and so much more.'

    'Meta Mind WorksÂ© rose out of a dozen years of research, study, and trading of the Forex market. MetaTrader has been my primary (Forex) platform that has allowed me to develop indicators, expert advisors, scripts, and accomplish technical market analysis through the use of the MQL4 programming language.',

    'After examining, researching, and modifying both common and esotaric indicators and studying filtering techniques, I settled on writing and using my own indicators as my primary trading tools.',

    'To forestall having to page through a myriad of charts, and also to make the trading experience more relaxed and comprehensive, I developed a dashboard that allows the monitoring of large groupings of currency pairs at one glance.  This dashboard supplies pertinent data in an easy to read format.  Expert advisors have been written and are also under development.',

    'A beta version of the dashboard is scheduled to go public in the fourth quarter of 2023'

    'Having a keen interest in quality audio  music listening, I often fell in with the audiophile crowds which led to being hired as the prototype manager at a high end electronics firm that primarily designed vacuum tube amplifiers.  After the company relocated out of state and during the care of a family member, I built two monoblock tube amplifiers and one preamplifier.  The power amplifiers are transformer coupled push-pull designs that utilize a mix of (Mosfet) current sources, current sinks, and resistors for controlling tube biasing.',

    '<center>Turn on delay circuit.',

    'Tube life is compromised when high voltage (HV) is applied to the anodes before the cathodes are up to temperature.  To deal with that, I added a microcontrolled circuit that senses the rectified zero crossing voltage and then, after a set delay time, slowly ramps up the HV.  This slow stepped turn on also helps minimize surge currents and component stresses.'

My present home stereo speakers are an MTM (aka D'Appolito) \"transmission line\" design.  I am presently working on a dipole configuration that will use active crossovers and, depending upon the woofer implementation, utilize 5 or 6 power amplifiers."
