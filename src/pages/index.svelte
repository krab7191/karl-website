  <p>Personal background:</p>
  &nbsp;
  <p>
    Described as an autodidactic polylog, I showed an interest in the sciences
    at age 4 by cutting through a live electrical lampcord with cuticle scissors
    (grandma wasn't happy with that). Weaned on crystal radios and vacuum tube
    equipment, I was raised in an environment where wood working, car repairs,
    flying, Ham radio (novice license at age 13), and other crafts were the
    norm. Concurrent with high school, I attended a vocational school where I
    studied electronics. After some college, I was employed repairing and
    maintaining biomedical equipment. This included both fluid and digital logic
    based equipment, and computer aided X-ray equipment. Still in my mid
    twenties, at the behest of a friend, I was cajoled into acquiring my series
    6 securities license and subsequently did work in a bond house for a short
    while. Later I returned to college to study of electrical engineering and
    ended up working in RF and Acoustics design and research (at Ericsson.) Extra
    curricular activities include dance, improvisational acting, and generally
    being physical in the out-of-doors.
